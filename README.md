This Churn prediction model involves analyzing historical data and using machine learning techniques to build predictive models that can forecast which employees are at a higher risk of churning.
Here's an overview of the steps involved in customer churn prediction:
**Data Preprocessing:** 
Clean and preprocess the collected data. This involves handling missing values, removing outliers, and transforming the data into a suitable format for analysis.

**Feature Selection/Engineering:**
Identifying and selecting important features (variables) that could influence customer churn. 

**Splitting Data:**
Divididing dataset into training and testing sets. The training set is used to build the predictive model, while the testing set helps evaluate its performance on unseen data.

**Model Selection:** 
Choosing appropriate machine learning algorithms for churn prediction. Common choices include logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, and neural networks. 

**Model Training:** 
Train the selected model on the training data. The model learns patterns and relationships within the data that can help predict churn.

**Model Evaluation:**
Use the testing dataset to evaluate the model's performance. Common evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC).

**Hyperparameter Tuning:**
Adjusting the hyperparameters of the model to optimize its performance. This might involve techniques like grid search or random search.

**Predicting Churn:**
Applying the trained model to new, unseen data to predict which customers are likely to churn.
